Your task is to create good old snake game where snake runs in a box and eats treats.

Technical requirements
•         Game must be written in pure javascript.
•         No third party libraries.
•         No canvas
•         Should work with latest Chrome. Other browsers support not required.

Game rules:
•         Each time snake eats the treat, new one will be created to random place.
          If snake wonders for too long (30 sec for instance) treat is repositioned.
•         Every now and then (interval should be configurable from code) snake gains speed,
          ie. level is increased.
•         when snake runs into a wall, game is over.
•         when snake bites itself, game is over.
•         snake starts from bottom center

Game features:
•         snake can move only one pixel at a time
•         pixel size is configurable (from code only)
•         box size is configurable (from code only)
•         game can be paused and resumed
•         progressive points - the higher the level, the higher points you get for eating
          the treat
•         display score
•         display level
